# Bitbucket API Client

We present a modern [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) API 2.0 client, by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).

This is strongly based on [php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api) by [KnpLabs](https://github.com/KnpLabs). With this in mind, we now have **very similar** clients for:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - [knplabs/github-api](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/github-api) by [KnpLabs](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) - [m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api](https://packagist.org/packages/m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api) by [Matt Humphrey](https://github.com/m4tthumphrey) et al.
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - [bitbucket/client](https://packagist.org/packages/bitbucket/client) which is this package!
